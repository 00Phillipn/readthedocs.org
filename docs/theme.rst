Read the Docs Theme
===================

This is the page about the Read the Docs default theme.
This `blog post`_ announcing it provides a lot of information about the design behind it.

We'll try and answer your questions here about how to customize the theme,
or make it function better.

If you have issues or feedback,
 please `open an issue`_ on the theme's GitHub repository.

How do I change the sidebar contents?
-------------------------------------

The sidebar is the global table of contents in Sphinx.
If you want to change the order or display,
simply update your toctree listing on the main index page of your site.
