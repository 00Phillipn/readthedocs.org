Google Summer of Code
=====================

Read the Docs is hoping to participate in the Google Summer of Code in 2014.
This page will contain all the information for students and anyone else interested in helping.

Required Skills
---------------

Incoming students will need the following skills:

* Intermediate python programming
* Familiarity with Markdown, reStructuredText, or some other plain text markup language
* Familiarity with git, or some other source control
* Ability to set up your own development environment for Read the Docs
* An interest in documentation and improving open source documentation tools would be great too!

We're happy to help you get up to speed, but the more you are able to demonstrate ability in advance, the more likely we are to choose your application! 

Getting Started
---------------

The :doc:`install` is probably the best place to get going.
It will walk you through getting a basic environment for Read the Docs setup. 

Then you can look through our :doc:`contribute` for information on how to get started contributing to RTD.
If you try and submit a patch,
or at least comment on a bug before applying,
you will be much more likely to be accepted.


Want to get involved?
