Design Decisions
================

Read the Docs does some things because we believe they are the proper way.
This page will outline some of the philsophy behind the design of the site.

You must have a repository
--------------------------

There is a lot of documentation out in the world, 
and you can't reproduce it, 
or download the code around it.
Read the Docs is designed around everything having a repository.
It's how much of our functionality is implemented,
and allows us more power in our interface.

This means that you can't upload static HTML to our site.
We believe that forcing you to put your docs into a repository is better for you,
and for your users.
