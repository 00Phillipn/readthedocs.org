Read the Docs Open Source Philosophy
-------------------------------------

Read the Docs is Free Software.
We have `licensed <https://github.com/rtfd/readthedocs.org/blob/master/LICENSE.mit>`_ the code base as MIT,
which provides almost no restrictions on the use of the code.

However,
as a project there are things that we care about more than others.
We built Read the Docs to support the Open Source Community.
The code is open for people to contribute to,
so that they may build features into readthedocs.org that they want.

Official Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The time of the core developers of Read the Docs is limited.
We provide official support for the following things:

* Local development on the Python code base
* Usage of https://readthedocs.org for Open Source projects
* Bug fixes in the code base, as it applies to running it on our production hardware

Unsupported
~~~~~~~~~~~

There are use cases that we don't support,
because it doesn't further our goal of promoting documentation in the Open Source Community.

We do not support:

* Specific usage of Sphinx and Mkdocs, that don't effort our hosting
* Custom installations of Read the Docs at your company
* Installation of Read the Docs on other platforms
* Any installation issues outside of the Read the Docs Python Code

Rationale
~~~~~~~~~

Read the Docs was founded to improve documentation in the Open Souce Community,
not at your Company.
We fully recognize and allow the code to be used for this purpose,
but we will not spend our time supporting it.
