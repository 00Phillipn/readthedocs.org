The Story of Read the Docs
==========================

Writing documentation is hard. So is finding the right documentation.
`Read the Docs`_ was created to make documentation simple.

Read the Docs was started with a couple main goals in mind. The first goal was
to encourage people to write documentation, by removing the barrier of entry to
hosting. The other goal was to create a central platform for people to find
documentation. Having a shared platform for all documentation allows for
innovation at the platform level, allowing work to be done once and benefit
everyone.

`Documentation matters`_, but its often overlooked. We think that we can help a
documentation culture flourish, in open source communities and in enterprise.
Great projects, such as Django_ and SQLAlchemy_, and projects from companies
like Mozilla_, are already using Read the Docs to serve their documentation to
the world.
