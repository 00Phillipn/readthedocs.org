Usage Questions
----------------

If you have questions about how to use Read the Docs,
`Stack Overflow`_ is the best place to ask.
Tag questions with ``read-the-docs`` so other folks can find them easily.

This is best for usage questions,
not issues that you think might be a bug.

Good questions for Stack Overflow would be:

* "What is the best way to structure the Table of Contents across a project?""
* "How do I structure translations inside of my project for easiest contribution from users?"
* "How do I use Sphinx to use SVG images in HTML output but PNG in PDF
output?""

Community Support
-----------------

Read the Docs is a community supported site.
Currently nobody is paid to handle readthedocs.org support.
We are hoping to bring in enough money with our `Gold`_ program to change that,
so please sign up if you are able.

**All people answering your questions are doing it with their own time,
so please be kind and provide as much infromation as possible.**
