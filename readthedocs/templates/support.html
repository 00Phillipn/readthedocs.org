<h3>Priority Support</h3>
<p>
Gold users have access to priority support for Read the Docs.
You can contact us at <a href="mailto:support@readthedocs.org">support@readthedocs.org</a>.
</p>
{% else %}
<h3>Community Support Support</h3>
<p>
Since Read the Docs is a community site,
we aren't able to offer any guarentees in support response time.
</p>

<p>
You can file a bug on our <a href="https://github.com/rtfd/readthedocs.org/issues">GitHub Issue Tracker</a>,
and it will be taken care of as soon as possible.
We do offer <strong>priority support</strong> to Gold users.
You can <a href="{% url "gold_register" %}">sign up</a> for Gold for access to priority support.
