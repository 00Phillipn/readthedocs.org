<h2> About Read the Docs </h2>

Read the Docs has <a href="http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/readthedocs.org">grown</a> over the past 4 years of it's life.
Today, we serve over 14 Million pages of documentation every month.
We have over 10 servers and serve over 2 TB of documentation a month.
There are over 18,000 projects and 25,000 users.
This is a large service by any measure.

<br><br>

As the site has grown,
the operational and support load has <a href="https://github.com/rtfd/readthedocs.org/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=created%3A%3E%3D2014-01-01&type=Issues">increased</a>.
Tasks like server monitoring, server maintenance, version upgrades, user account management, and many other tasks are not suited to volunteer effort.
We are asking for your money to help offer better operational support and customer support for all our users.

<br><br>

<h3> Support us </h3>

<br><br>

We are hoping to initially raise $24,000 to use money to make sure work on Read the Docs gets done.
This will allow us to provide for 40 hours a week at $50/hr to get work done.
This money will likely be spread across operations and support tasks each week,
and across multiple people willing to do the work.

<br><br>

<h3>Vision</h3>

<br><br>

When we reach our goal of $24,000,
Read the Docs will be in a much more sustainable place.
However,
that is only covering the most basic of operational services.
We also are making changes to the code that runs the site to make it easier to contribute
This will allow more community contributions for new features,
and we will be able to better onboard new contributors.

<br><br>

<h3> Current Status </h3>

Read the Docs is currently underwater in terms of support.
We know there is work we need to do so that the community can get more involved.
However,
we don't have time do to that work because other things are more urgent.
The goal of this program is to help us in getting to a state where we can become more self-sufficient in terms of community support.

<br><br>

<h3> Existing Support </h3>

Our servers are graciously sponsored by <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/">Rackspace</a> at a cost of $2,000 every month.
They are our single largest sponsor,
and Read the Docs wouldn't be possible without their generous support.
We also have a full list of <a href="http://docs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/sponsors.html#past-sponsors">past sponsors</a> in our documentation.

<br><br>

We have used <a href="https://gratipay.com/readthedocs/">Gratipay</a> for sustaining donations of this kind previously.
We are moving off of this platform,
and will be looking into a more sustainable model after the initial three months of this program.
We plan on that being a recurring payment model that will allow us to forecast and sustain a standard amount of billable hours per month.

<br><br>

<h3> Alternative Support </h3>

Read the Docs is an open source project.
You can help us also by looking at <a href="https://github.com/rtfd/readthedocs.org/issues">issues</a> or submitting patches.
Sharing this page with your friends would also help us out.
