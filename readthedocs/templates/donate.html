<h2> About Read the Docs </h2>

Read the Docs has <a href="http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/readthedocs.org">grown</a> over the past 4 years of it's life.
Today, we serve over 14 Million pages of documentation every month.
We have over 10 servers and serve over 2 TB of documentation a month.
There are over 18,000 projects and 25,000 users.
This is a large service by any measure.

<br><br>

As the site has grown,
the operational and support load has <a href="https://github.com/rtfd/readthedocs.org/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=created%3A%3E%3D2014-01-01&type=Issues">increased</a>,
but the contributor base <a href="https://github.com/rtfd/readthedocs.org/graphs/contributors?from=2014-01-01&to=2015-04-01&type=c">hasn't</a>.
This entire ecosystem is effectively supported by two people who are paid less than $2,000 each a month.
We are asking for your money to help offer better operational support and customer support for these users.

<br><br>

Read the Docs is much harder to support than a typical Open Source project.
We have to keep the servers running,
wear pagers,
debug build failures,
and a lot more that takes constant small amounts of time.

<br><br>

<h3> Support us </h3>

If you use Read the Docs on a daily basis,
you should support us.
There is a good chance you use it every day,
even if you don't notice.
We host documentation for every programming language and community.

<br><br>

We are hoping to raise $24,000, to support us over the next three months.
We will add $2,000/mo to each out our income, bringing it to $4,000/mo each.
This will allow us to spend more of our time working on Read the Docs,
instead of doing other things to make money.
We will also contract a part time support engineer to help with customer support.
If you are interested in filling this position,
please <a href="mailto:hello@readthedocs.org">email us</a>.

<br><br>

When we reach our goal of $24,000,
Read the Docs should be in a much more sustainable place.
However,
that is only covering the most basic of services.
We hope to be able to increase the support from the community over time by adding premium features.
This will help us do feature development and make the site better,
instead of simply being able to support the existing platform.

<br><br>

<h3> Current Status </h3>

Read the Docs is currently underwater in terms of support.
We know there is work we need to do so that the community can get more involved.
However,
we don't have time do to that work because other things are more urgent.
The goal of this program is to help us in getting to a state where we can become more self-sufficient in terms of community support.

<br><br>

I believe there will always be a need for a basic level of paid support though,
because operations and other disruptive tasks difficult to find volunteers for.
Also enough people depend on Read the Docs to get their jobs done,
someone should be paid and responsible for this.

<br><br>

<h3> Existing Support </h3>

Our servers are graciously sponsored by Rackspace at a cost of $2,000 every month.
They are our single largest sponsor,
and Read the Docs wouldn't be possible without their generous support.

<br><br>

We have used <a href="https://gratipay.com/readthedocs/">Gittip</a> for sustaining donations of this kind previously.
We are moving off of this platform,
and will be looking into a more sustainable model after the initial three months of this program.

<br><br>

<h3> Alternative Support </h3>

Read the Docs is an open source project.
You can help us also by looking at <a href="https://github.com/rtfd/readthedocs.org/issues">issues</a> or submitting patches.
Sharing this fundraiser with your friends would also help us out.
