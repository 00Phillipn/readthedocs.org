  <h2>About Read the Docs</h2>

  <p>
    Read the Docs has <a href="http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/readthedocs.org">grown</a> over the past 4 years of it's life.
    Today, we:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li> Serve over <b>14 Million pages</b> of documentation a month. </li>
    <li> Have 10 servers and serve over <b>2 TB</b> of documentation a month. </li>
    <li> Host over <b>18,000 projects and 25,000 users</b>. </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    As the site has grown,
    the operational and support load has <a href="https://github.com/rtfd/readthedocs.org/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=created%3A%3E%3D2014-01-01&type=Issues">increased</a>.
    Tasks like server monitoring, server maintenance, version upgrades, user account management, and many other tasks are not suited to volunteer effort.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>We are asking for your money to help offer better operational support and customer support for all our users.</b>
  </p>


  <h3>Outcomes</h3>

  <p>
    We are hoping to initially raise $24,000.
    We will use this money to pay for crucial tasks to get done.
    This will allow us to provide for 40 hours a week at $50/hr.
    This money will likely be spread across operations and support tasks each week,
    and across multiple people to do the work.
  </p>

  <p>
    When we reach our goal,
    Read the Docs will be in a much more sustainable place.
    Part of improving our support is onboarding new contributors to the codebase.
    We also are making changes to the code that will make it easier to contribute.
    The goal being to have more core contributors working on the fun features that volunteers are great at building.
  </p>

  <h3>Existing Support</h3>

  <p>
    Our servers are graciously sponsored by <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/">Rackspace</a> at a cost of $2,000 every month.
    They are our single largest sponsor,
    and Read the Docs wouldn't be possible without their generous support.
    We also have a full list of <a href="http://docs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/sponsors.html#past-sponsors">past sponsors</a> in our documentation.
  </p>

  <p>
    We have used <a href="https://gratipay.com/readthedocs/">Gratipay</a> for sustaining donations of this kind previously.
    We are moving off of this platform,
    and will be looking into a more sustainable model after the initial three months of this program.
    We plan on that being a recurring payment model that will allow us to forecast and sustain a standard amount of billable hours per month.
